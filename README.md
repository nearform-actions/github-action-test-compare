# github-action-test-compare

**Compare tests against production**

This GitHub Action automatically runs the tests within a PR against the target branch and adds a warning comment to the PR if the tests pass. This action's intention is to test if the PR is testing the right thing. The action is suitable for PRs that contain fixes and corresponding tests.

The action runs the following process:

- Checks out the PR branch
- Checks out the target branch into a target folder (`targetFolder`)
- Copies the PR tests (`tests`) to the target folder
- Installs dependencies (`installCommand`) and executes the tests (`testCommand`) in the target folder
- Warns if tests pass within the target folder
- Optionally removes a specified label (`label`) from the PR

## Usage

## Maintenance

This is a [composite GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action) tested with [act-js](https://github.com/kiegroup/act-js) and [Mock GitHub](https://github.com/kiegroup/mock-github).

When running tests locally with `npm test`, you must have [Act](https://github.com/nektos/act) installed and available at `/usr/local/bin/act`.

You can enable Act logging with `npm run test:log` - the output is written to `.log` files in the root folder.

You can run only changed tests with `npm run test:changed` or `npm run test:changed:log`.
